/*
This solution involves a few concepts:

1. Converting the array into a hashset allows us to identify the existence of a number in O(1) time. It also removes duplicates
2. Each item in a hashset could potentially be the start of its own subsequence. We can identify this by checking if the item-1 exists in the hashset.
3. If the item is the start of a subsequence, we can then check for consecutive suffixes by incrementing the item by 1 until we find a number that 
    doesn't exist in the hashset.
4. We can then compare the length of the current sequence with the incumbent sequence to determine the longest sequence.
